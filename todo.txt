Todo:

- Secondary connection failure handling and reconnection.

  o Need more edge case tests.

    - close due to error in input


- ZConfig support and process setup.

  This is mostly done.  I'll remove this from the list when I have:

  - Install/setup instructions

  - rpm

- Need direct test of fsiterator in case when there is extension data.

- Add error if a unix-domain socket is used in zconfig.

- Need test of secondary in ZEO.

Issues:

- The restore method, which seems to exist primarily for ZRS is buggy
  in it's handling of version data.  The tests for it are so general,
  they don't catch the fact that non-version data aren't handled
  correctly, even though, FileStorage is the only storage that
  implements restore. :(

  It was rather lame to put restore in FileStorage.  It probably would
  have been better to subclass FileStorage to add restore.  

  We're going to ignore this for now.

- There are weird issues with packing -- especially for the tests.
  The recovery process can cause secondaries to get into states that
  aren't possible for primaries.  For example, secondaries can have
  unpacked records followed by packed records.  Or all packed records
  including packed records that have been packed away on the
  primary. Ideosyncrasies of the FileStorage packing code make this
  worse. 

  I plan to redo the FileStorage packing code to:

  1. Make it more efficient by trading memory for seeks, replacing the
     current code that does lots of random access, with code that
     makes mostly two passes through the file.

  2. Make it much simpler.
