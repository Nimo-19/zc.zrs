        The address at which the server should listen.  This can be in
        the form 'host:port' to signify a TCP/IP connection or a
        pathname string to signify a Unix domain socket connection (at
        least one '/' is required).  A hostname may be a DNS name or a
        dotted IP address.  If the hostname is omitted, the platform's
        default behavior is used when binding the listening socket (''
        is passed to socket.bind() as the hostname portion of the
        address).
